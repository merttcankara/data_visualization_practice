# Data Visualization Practice (Matplotlib + Plotly)

This notebook is a hands-on data visualization practice project focusing on building clear, insight-driven charts using real-world style datasets. It includes static visualizations with Matplotlib and interactive charts with Plotly.

## What’s inside

**Matplotlib (static visualization)**
- Line charts to explore GDP trends (World Bank style data)
- Highlighting patterns around periods like the **2008 crisis**
- Peak detection on time series using **SciPy (`find_peaks`)**
- Scatter plots (Population vs Surface Area)
- Country code annotations with **pycountry (ISO-3)**
- Color-mapped scatter plots using GDP as a third dimension (+ colorbar)

**Plotly Express (interactive visualization)**
- Line and scatter visualizations using the built-in **Gapminder** dataset
- Hover interaction and log-scale examples

## Data files

The notebook expects the following CSV files (same directory as the notebook):

- `Worldbank_GDP_Data.csv` 
- `Worldbank Population Data.csv`
- `Worldbank Country Area.csv`
